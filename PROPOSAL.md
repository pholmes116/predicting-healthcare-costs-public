## Project proposal form

Please provide the information requested in the following form. Try to provide concise and informative answers.

## Candidate numbers: 37386, 

**1. What is your project title?**

Clustering or building recommender systems for procedure codes based on Electronic Health Record (EHR) data

**2. What is the problem that you want to solve?**

Compile patient data from various EHR data sources into a consolidated patient profile that captures the relevant information required to provide efficient care to patients. After operationalizing this process, we will run k-means clustering across the various CSV files to cluster patients based on their procedure codes. K-means clustering will highlight which variables are relevant in predicting the patient's procedure using their demographic and registration information. 


**3. What big data methodologies and tools do you plan to use?**

Recommender system, Spark dataframes, SparkML/DBSCAN on Spark (clustering algorithms), feature transformers to create the patient profile dataframes

<You may consider any methods and tools to acquire, preprocess, store, analyse, and present results - as a traditional big data science pipeline>

**4. What dataset will you use? You may assess the suitability of the dataset for distributed computing for big data. Provide information about the dataset (size, features and labels, if applicable) and a URL for the dataset if available. If you intend to generate synthetic data, provide a description of what features you will use, whether your dataset is labelled or not (supervised versus unsupervised learning problem), how will it be generated (any functions, seed values, data ranges etc) and the expected size. When choosing or generating data, please remember to consider any aspects related to data representativeness, quality, bias and other aspects relevant to your project**
